The important skill that you'll be learning in this
lesson is how to make asynchronous requests in Redux.
If you recall, the way Redux works right now is:
 - store.dispatch() calls are made
 - if the Redux store was set up with any middleware, those functions are run
 - then the reducer is invoked

 Instead what you can do is a technique called --optimistic
 updates--. Instead of waiting for confirmation from the
 server, just instantly remove the user from the UI when
 the user clicks “delete”, then, if the server responds
 back with an error that the user wasn’t actually deleted,
you can add the information back in. This way your user
gets that instant feedback from the UI, but, under the hood,
the request is still asynchronous.
