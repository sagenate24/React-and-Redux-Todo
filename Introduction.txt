Lesson 1 - Managing State
Lesson 2 - UI + Redux
Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware
Lesson 4 - Redux with React
Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux
Lesson 6 - React-redux
Lesson 7 - Real World Redux

Lesson 1:
  Techniques to make state more predictable by moving state to
  a central Location and establishing strict rules for getting,
  listening, and updating state.

Lesson 2:
  Move away from having state live in the DOM by creating a
  vanilla Javascript application whose state is manegd entirely
  by Redux.

Lesson 3:
  Create custom middleware and add it to your Redux store.
  This middleware will allow you to enhance your store by
  hooking into and intercepting actions before the reach any
  reducers.

Lesson 4:
  Add React to a Redux application and have the state of that
  application be managed by Redux.

Lesson 5:
  Learn to better abstract asynchronous events by creating a
  custom thunk middleware and adding it to your store.

Lesson 6:
  Learn to leverage the react-redux bindings in order to leverage
  the benefits of a UI library like React and a state
  management library like Redux.

Lesson 7:
  Take your knowledge of Redux and utilize it by building a
  real world Redux application. Also will learn advanced
  Redux topics like reducer composition and normalization.
