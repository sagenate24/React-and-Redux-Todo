Redux middle ware - how it helps us hook into the Redux
Lifecycle and how it is benificial.

check and dispatch then store.dispatch then reducer.

change checkAndDispatch function with redux middleWare.

MiddleWare: â€¦a third-party extension point between
dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.

What's great about middleware is that once it receives the action, it can carry out a number of operations, including:

1. producing a side effect (e.g., logging information about the store)
2. processing the action itself (e.g., making an asynchronous HTTP request)
3. redirecting the action (e.g., to another piece of middleware)
4. dispatching supplementary actions
