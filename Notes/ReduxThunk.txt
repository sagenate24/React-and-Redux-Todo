Action Creator in redux thunk.
keep our ui logic away from our api code.
action creators will become the source of every change in state

A connected component is connected to the Redux store and is responsible for getting data from the store.
A presentational component should not access the store. It should receive any information it needs as props and then just render a UI.
const buildConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps);

connect() connects a React component to the Redux store.
The mapStateToProps() function allows us to specify
which state from the store you want passed to your React
component, while the mapDispatchToProps() function allows
us to bind dispatch to action creators before they ever hit
the component.
